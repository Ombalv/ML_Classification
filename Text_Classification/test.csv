11,"I don't think there would be a practical difference between them ""denying"" the request, and them approving but not finding someone else, which they could still legally do while charging you rent.

However it's unlikely they'd do this as the agent gets a commission when they re-lease the property. And the landlord gets to increase the rent. So they have an incentive to find someone new."

36,"I would try some social meetups that involve an activity, like boardgames as it allows for a more relaxed setting that doesn't have to force conversation. There is a ton on Meetups, although don't treat these events as dating events. Just go with the open mind of meeting new people and making friends. You can be friends with a female without it being romantic.


Also some pointers for men who have limited relationship experience (this includes female friends):

- A lot of women are nice because they're afraid of how men will react so don't assume they are flirting with you.

- If you ask them out and they say no, don't get upset and turn on them or make them feel unsafe. Don't harass them on social media either.

- Do not touch, hug, or invade her personal space without consent first. This is one of the biggest things that make women feel unsafe. Don't be offended if she says no, some people generally aren't affectionate people.

- Actually get to know them and give the relationship time so she can feel comfortable. If you ask her out too early, she may feel overwhelmed, pressured or scared of how you will react if she says no.

- Don't let her wait by herself at night. Either offer to wait with her or find someone she trusts to (if you don't know her very well)

- Communicate. Your boundaries, needs, wants etc. and when she opens up about things, don't get defensive. Provide a safe space for her to be vulnerable. And she should do the same.

Of course people have these expectations in their head and get upset when the person doesn't live up to them. So, always communicate this, and ask her to do the same. We can't read minds sadly. (My BF says, ""use your words"" when I'm upset about something and thinks he should know what I'm upset about)

- Determine if this person is actually compatible with you and will meet your needs. Forcing something with someone for the sake of loneliness will just make you more miserable. Your partner should be someone who supports all your hobbies, doesn't aim to change/control you, can be vulnerable and provide that emotional support and can communicate.

- Listen to and remember things she says/likes etc. She will tell you even if it's in passing conversation. This shows you care. Figuring out each other's love language is help too.


This obviously relates to all genders, but these are things I've found are common issues for women when they try to put themselves out there socially, or when they are asked out.

I met my partner at a social boardgame meetup as I am ND and struggle with activities that involved forced conversation only. I asked him out after some time and being open in our communication and providing a safe space for vulnerability has allowed for the most amazing relationship I've ever been in."

42,"Yes, water around  the root zones, water everywhere. More frequent/less volume watering are more beneficial in the heat, the plants are having a hard time and it?s likely there is moisture down deep below, just not enough around all the roots to keep up with the plants needs in hot conditions."
43,"Buying rounds. When out with others who earn the same or more, we end up in rounds at the pub. Can get expensive! We don't expect junior staff to buy us drinks. When I earned less I'd just buy myself drinks and not get involved in a round. 

I don't feel that I go out more often now but I'm not concerned about my budget for the night. I'll order what I want from the menu instead of thinking about the total bill. 

I pay for services such as a cleaner and gardener and car washing, as I value my free time more since my job is now busier. I get an Uber rather than the bus if it's wet or I CBA to wait. 

My biggest expense since getting to my current salary is joining a fancy gym. I used to be of the mentality that my ú40 per month council pool and gym was fine, but since joining the fancy gym I go more often and have a much nicer time. It will be the last thing I give up should I lose this salary. 

I do budget for my nights out and spending on impulsive crap to some extent but I won't be stressed if I go over the budget. 

I fully recognise that I'm fortunate here, as I grew up with very little money at home and my first few years in London were on sub 25k. It's much more difficult to have a comfortable life on a low salary these days."

50,"The front counter is part of what the police station calls the ?watch house?. There are slight differences between each station but usually there will be 2-4 police officers working in the watch house and here is a list of all the things they might be doing which delays them getting to the front counter:

- Answering phones. Even with PAL/131 444 the station phones ring constantly and those calls can take some time to resolve.ˇ
- Taking statements/dealing with victims. If a serious enough crime has been reported it might take one of the watch house officers out of circulation for an hour or more while they take a statement, complete reports and do notifications.ˇ
- Completing reports. Reported crimes that come in via phone or the counter have to be recorded onto LEAP.ˇ
- Issuing equipment. Every police officer out on patrol has to have all their equipment issued to them. The watch house staff retrieve and issue the equipment. At every shift change the equipment has to be counted to make sure nothing is missing.ˇ
- Trying to resolve jobs over the phone. If a unit isn?t available or a 000 job can be processed over the phone then the watch house will be directed by the patrol supervisor to ring complainants/victims and resolve incidents over the phone.ˇ
- Custody. Some stations require watch house staff to assist with receiving/releasing arrestees brought into the station.ˇ"

55,"Not that weird imo, I'd double check what they may have ordered when drunk.  I've worked in bougie clubs for years. It was probably cirque/tabu/reign one of the lower end west end clubs (all use promoters and have girls dancing in lingerie). They rely heavily on promoters bringing in pretty young girls to get drunk to make VIP look interesting, thus making the venue look appealing to older spender perverts. 

If they didn't order a drink from the waiting staff or the bar and were only handed them by the promoter or were pouring from the bottle on his table, they don't have to pay shit. This is the standard agreement, we show up, you give us drinks, we dance, you look like you have tons of girl friends, it's transactional. 

If they did order a bottle or glass and drank it then yes sadly they will be paying for it... But if they didnt tell them to say 'absolutely not, here is the evidence (text or whatever) that we came on a promoter table and his name is (insert name here) and he gave us the alcohol.

My wife and I are deciding on a river cruise to take this Spring/Early Summer and were wondering about what Paris is going to be like in the late April/Early May time frame. With the olympics coming, our concern is that the city is going to be crazy busy (more than normal) getting ready and construction might make some of the sightseeing difficult. 

But, if the major construction is done and the city is going to be ""ready and waiting"" we are really interested in coming to see it. Neither of us have been yet (American) so we are excited about the possibility.

Thanks for any info in advance!"
69,"I?d recommend saving enough money to live on campus for your first year, it?s fairly equivalent to the costs for living out of home the only catch is that it?s all up front. Uni will cost more than you think, textbooks are incredibly expensive and they charge the same amount for digital books (such a scam). 

Once you?re settled in and have found a job and made some friends here it?ll be a lot easier for your second year to find a share house, plus you?ll have a much better idea of how to get around, where you?ll want to live, and how to get everything you?ll need cheaper over time rather than all at once. 

An awful lot of rural kids and interstate kids do the same thing. It?s much more social to live in the residential and has built in study assistance sessions at a lot of the halls. It?s bloody hard to move away from friends and family by yourself at any age, let alone at 18, and it?s a great option for first year."

71,"Hello, je vis Ö Paris et il est effectivement difficile de se faire de nouveaux amis, passÇ un certaine age. Voici nÇanmoins quelques conseils : 

? Si tu aimes la musique (electro ou house), rejoins le groupe ""Techno Flex et detente"" sur Facebook, beaucoup de gens partagent des soirÇes en boite, et dans les commentaires pas mal de personnes sont seuls et recherche des gens avec qui aller aÖ la soirÇe. Ce groupe est un exemple, il est en existe plein en fonctions de ton style de musique. 

? Par experience, aller Ö des festivals, c'est aussi le meilleur moyen de rencontrer des gens et de se lier d'amitiÇ avec eux. Les gens sont gÇnÇralement assez ouvert, et accepte qu'une personne rejoigne le groupe (pour la journÇe, mais souvent apräs pour d'autres Çvänements !) 

? Les bars Ö jeux. J'en connais un qui s'appelle ""Le Dernier Bar avant la Fin du Monde"" Ö chatelet. Peut-àtre que c'est plus facile d'aborder un groupe de deux personnes. 

? Si tu as des hobbies, essaye de regarder si il n'y a pas des groupes liÇs Ö áa sur les reseaux sociaux. 

  
Sinon mon dernier conseil est le suivant : perseverance. Faire l'effort d'entretenir des relations avec tes collägues. D'aborder des gens en soirÇe. Tu es encore jeune, cela risque d'àtre plus difficile passer les 30 ans ;-) 

Courage."
72,"In a half filled carriage there?s no reason someone can?t put their bag next to them. And there?s nothing wrong with asking. Same for well, young and able bodied people sitting in priority seats. They?re allowed to be there until someone with priority requests. 

There are limits of course, but I?ve seen many people carrying large items on pt and sometimes it?s a little inconvenient. Then I remember they?re not using a car and it?s much better for everyone.

General pt rules: just be reasonable and don?t overreact. Don?t blame someone else cause you?re too awkward to ask either."
73,"Today .. I got a reminder that it's a death anniversary day. Thing is I don't keep these dates in mind, am I cold? My godfather sent me an amazing text saying he was thinking of me and meanwhile .. it's a normal day. Then I felt so.. bad. For not marking it you know? I think of my parents in different ways on different days, different moments ... Just not on birthdays or death days."
74,"Find resolve within yourself first bro, relationships and romance these days are fleeting and transient in nature. There's more to life outside of intimacy and once you free yourself from that mentality - you've got all the time and energy to invest in yourself. 

You could get a pet, take up a new skill or hobby, put effort into your health and wellbeing. Relationships can be exhausting, and catering to someone that may not have your wellbeing as a priority will only fuck you up.

Once you do the groundwork and get yourself in a better spot, i'm sure that the right person for you, will find their way into your life."

RÇsultat : tu passes jamais parce que la foule est compacte. 

Du coup jai que des choix de merde :

- soit je force comme un goret quand le feu est vert pour moi et je me fais copieusement insulter par les piÇtons qui ne comprennent pas que quand le bonhomme est rouge faut arràter et continuent de traverser (l'inertie de la foule toussa toussa), 

- soit je crame le rouge au tout dÇbut de la phase car Ö ce moment lÖ dans la phase de feu les piÇtons ont aussi rouge et n?ont pas encore commencÇs Ö traverser (parce que pour rappel la voie voiture Ö cìtÇ elle a un feu vert), 

- soit je passe par la voie voiture et m?insäre de faáon totalement illÇgale dans la piste pour pas me faire insulter par les bagnolards derriäre qui sont incapables de faire 100m derriäre un vÇlo sans mourir et faire vrombir le moteur ou ecraser le klaxon, parce que Æˇy?a une piste Ö cìtÇ connard de cyclisteˇØ

82,"Jesus Christ they?ve had four years to come up with names for the line and all are completely shit!

Nothing whatsoever to do with the areas they serve or geographic locations, as I suspected they were renamed to score political points.

Of course they couldn?t rename the East London line to the Brunel line, after the man who built the line in the first place for reasons that it?s not correct to celebrate a white man

Suffragette line??? That sounds like a line that is forever plagued with delays, Lioness line sounds cringe as fuck, and Liberty line?? What does that have to do with the line that should be called Rominster line (Romford to Upminster line) 

I largely suspect that many will still call it either the ?Overground? or their old names of East London line or North London line, since i really don?t see these names catching on whatsoever 

Khan/TfL have really dropped the ball on this one, easy names are

East London - Brunel (after the man who designed and built the line

North London - Olympic (after the Olympic stadium at Stratford and Kensington Olympia)

Watford - Harlequin (Harlesden and Queens Park, also a 90s throwback to the Network South East days)

[The London Cycling Campaign have a (free!) cycle buddies scheme](https://lcc.org.uk/groups/cycle-buddies/) where you can team up with some more experienced cyclists where you live, to help newer (or newer to London) cyclists feel more confident on the road.

If no one picks up the phone after calling non-stop till 8am, then try calling 811 to get a walk-in appointment booked (but expect being on hold/transferred for at least 30min-1 hour). Once you see the walk-in doctor, tell them to refer you to Polyclinique Centre-Ville ORL on rue Sainte-Antoine.

137,"Mon päre Çtait policier et dans les annÇes 1990, jusqu'Ö sa retraite, Çtait dans une escouade spÇcialisÇe dans le vol et recel de vÇhicules et de piäces.

? l'Çpoque, la majoritÇ des vÇhicules volÇs Çtaient dÇsassemblÇs dans des ""cours Ö scrap"", les piäces Çtaient maquillÇes et revendues sur les marchÇs locaux et continentaux.

C'Çtait plus difficile de camoufler les opÇrations parce que les vÇhicules Çtaient transportÇs Ö des lieux fixes. On pouvait aussi remonter une filiäre de piäces. Le principal dÇfi Çtait la coordination entre services de police de plusieurs municipalitÇs. Mais les coups de filet Çtaient frÇquents.

Aujourd'hui... C'est un marchÇ et un modus operandi complätement diffÇrents. Les vÇhicules ne convergent pas vers des lieux spÇcifiques pour àtre modifiÇs ou dÇsassemblÇs. Ils sont plutìt envoyÇs le plus rapidement possible Ö l'extÇrieur d'une juridiction. Loin de dÇcourager le vol, l'Çlectronique semble le faciliter: interception de signaux de clÇs, clonage de dispositifs d'accäs, hack de l'unitÇ ECU par le port OBD2, etc. Et les services de tracking de vÇhicule ont une utilitÇ somme toute träs limitÇe, d'autant plus qu'il est possible de les neutraliser.

Le mouvement des vÇhicules volÇs sur de grandes distances, rapidement, et leur insertion dans les services de fret (conteneurs) font en sorte que les services de police locaux ont träs peu de moyens pour agir. Äa prendrait de grosses escouades de la SQ et de la GRC, plus l'implication des autoritÇs portuaires et des douanes. Actuellement c'est plutìt dÇsorganisÇ.

141,"**Abbey Wood v Walthamstow for buying a flat.**

I'm looking to buy a flat and I'm currently torn between 2 options.
  

  
They are both quite similar, just that one is a 2 minute walk from Abbey Wood station and the other is a 5 minute walk from St James Street station/a 10 minute walk from Walthamstow Central station.
  

  
I work near Moorgate so the commute time is similar though the commute from Abbey Wood is on the Elizabeth Line, which offers a slightly quicker door-to-door journey time and, importantly (especially if running late!) far more frequent trains (12tph vs just 4tph on the ""Weaver"" Overground line from St James Street station).
  

  
I'm of the view that the area surrounding Abbey Wood, though currently pretty dead, has a quite a bit of natural beauty nearby (Southmere Park/Lake and Abbey Wood) and will get more lively soon. Walthamstow; however, seems much more established - it is quite lively and is getting nicer plus the Wetlands seems a nice local perk.

You will learn when it's safe to drive just like anyone else who is learning to drive. Anyone saying otherwise is just being an ableist."
183,"To get an employer to sponsor a work visa you will need a degree they recognize and be well qualified in an in-demand field, as the employer will have to show that they cannot find an equally qualified candidate who is an EU citizen. The US Bachelor's degree has no equivalent in France, and anyway the locals you will be competing with in the job market will all have Master's degrees, so you should plan on at least a bit of grad school.

Even then, I think it will be near impossible to get hired straight out of school from the US unless you are in very niche field or you've done something that really makes you stand out, like a Ph.D. on an emerging topic or something like that. As another poster mentioned, a good route might be to get your Bachelor's in the US, then come to France for the Master's. As part of your Master's program, you will likely do an internship or two in a French company (depending on your field of study), and then have the right to stay in France for awhile (a year, I think?) to look for a job. Nearly every Master's program in France will require you to be near-fluent in French before you begin your studies, so get started now if you haven't already.

If you go the Ph.D. route (or some other advanced degree or specialization) the challenge you will run into is that you will have to guess what the French employment market will want X years from now. I did not choose to do a Ph.D. as a way to move to Europe -- nor should you, it's too big a commitment for that to be your motivation -- but when I finished, people skilled in my area were in high demand here. But years later, that is no longer the case and there's no way I would be hired from the US if I graduated with the same credentials today.

As far as *what* to study, degrees in STEM fields travel well and, with a few exceptions, generally do not have any local licensing requirements that make it hard to move. I have known people in non-STEM fields who have moved, such as a musician who was able to support herself (barely) and an art historian with a Ph.D. who got a museum job. And despite there being no shortage of wine experts in France, I have known more than one person who has moved to France and make a good self-employed living teaching people (tourists, mostly) about wine and taking them to vineyards. Ultimately, you should do something you're going to enjoy."
184,"Similar thing happened to me (26M) the other night. Around 9pm walking along Brighton Road in Elwood, man starts following me yelling ?come back here f@ggot, you wanna fight? I?ll bash your head in? etc etc. 

Thankfully I saw a young couple walking towards me about 70m in front so I sprinted up to them and asked if I could walk with them for a while. 

The man catches up and asks them ?if this f@g your friend?? to which the girl quickly responds ?yeah we?ve been looking for him!? Scary man says ?you know he?s a f@ggot right?? And she answers that we have to go now.

193,"I have a mate who?s 39 and has only ever had one girlfriend for about a month. There?s nothing really wrong with him, but he just doesn?t do anything to get himself out there. I say this because there?s a good chance there?s nothing really wrong with you, life just got in the way, you?ve been repeating the same stuff every week, and never really did much about meeting someone. 

What?s worked for me in the past:

- OK Cupid: Met my last two girlfriends on there and other interesting people, some who I?m still friends with even if no romance eventuated. I haven?t used the site for 5 years, but it was great back then. Women will always get a shit tone more likes than guys, it?s just how it is. Keep trying, if you?re interested in meeting someone. It was 95% failures, 5% success and didn?t happen overnight. It took many dates to click with someone, but it did happen. Unfortunately a lot of people have to meet up online nowadays. 

- Meetup: The site/app is a good way to meet people who share a hobby. Or other activities that are great to get introduced to new people. 

- Volunteering: Good way to meet more people. Along with other activities like Pickleball or something. 

- Your weight: I?m not in great shape either. But let?s be honest, you?re way more likely to find someone if you?re in better shape. So I?d be working on that. Lovey dovey comments that ?it?s what?s on the inside that counts? are just bs. We need to take care of our bodies and the reality is that women generally don?t want to date people who don?t take care of themselves. And why should they? If we don?t respect ourselves and our bodies, why should they?

- Antisocial stuff: are you really getting yourself out there? Or just staying at home or going to the same places all the time where you can?t meet anyone? Do more things that put you in settings with other people and increases your chance of meeting someone.

On the last point, I have another friend who?s always complaining about not having someone. But she spends all of zero time looking for someone. I tell her to go to dating sites but they?re ?not her thing.? So be honest about yourself and whether you?re really doing what?s required to find someone, then being prepared to go through the number?s game."
194,"Funny how just yesterday I saw a video on here about this guy who got his truck stolen but he had stashed an Airtag in his truck and he traced it back to the port of Montreal.

195,"There was a new build house I was interested in and listed by Foxtons. Booked a viewing and on the day a different person turned up with no idea about any of the questions I asked. Saw some issues and didn't think much of it and proceeded. Solicitor raised big red flags and the Foxtons agent just kept basically gaslighting me saying it's my solicitor that's useless not them or the seller.

The purchase fell through and I'm glad it did because a few months later I looked up the property was being auctioned off as seen, with a planning enforcement notice against the property, valued by Savills at 30% below the price Foxtons was marketing at."

197,"Does anyone have the full video? I was originally on the side of the cyclist, can't stand drivers on their phones. But the video in the article above shows a motorcyclist with pillion passing between the range rover and the cyclist, which would indicate the cyclist is on the wrong side of the road, and had presumably stopped in the middle of the road in order to capture the driver on camera. If that's the case, then yeah, there would be grounds to charge the cyclist. As others have said, 2 wrongs don't make a right. But I think watching the full video would explain the situation more."

You have to be lightning fast when booking a ticket as they are first come first serve. Make sure you create your account and are connected to it before the sale opens, it helps if you can connect your computer to the internet via cable. Have the page open on the show you are booking, keep an eye on a clock that has the seconds count and hit that refresh button. Once you?re in you get sent to a waiting list, time to breathe a little, and after that is done you are able to purchase 2 tickets max, don?t bother losing time trying to select your category, the faster you are the better your seats will be.

207,"[The TrocadÇro Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad%C3%A9ro_Palace):
> The TrocadÇro Palace was an eclectic building of Moorish and neo-Byzantine inspiration dating from the second half of the 19th century. Located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, on the Chaillot hill between the Place du TrocadÇro and the gardens of the same name, it comprised a 4,600-seat auditorium extended on either side by two curved wings, each housing a museum (the MusÇe des Monuments Franáais and the MusÇe d'Ethnographie), as well as conference rooms.

> Built for the 1878 Exposition Universelle, it was not intended to outlast the event; although the building was eventually preserved for some sixty years, it was widely criticized for its architectural style, its progressive dilapidation, and the poor acoustics of its main hall, which was soon deserted by orchestras. It was dismantled in 1935 in preparation for the 1937 Exposition Universelle, to make way for a new building, the [Palais de Chaillot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_de_Chaillot)."

211,"Contrairement Ö ce que l'on pourrait croire, chacun des Çtablissements que tu as citÇs proposent des parcours en informatique assez singuliers, màme si Ö la fin, tu auras plus ou moins accäs aux màmes mÇtiers.

Dans le cadre d'une licence informatique, il faut savoir que ces formations possädent toutes une premiäre annÇe de tronc commun scientifique que l'on peut classer du plus au moins gÇnÇral :

1.  Sorbonne UniversitÇs (SU) dispensent de cours assez intensifs qui couvrent les mathÇmatiques, la physique et l'informatique. C'est la licence qui selon moi peut t'ouvrir le plus de porte däs la premiäre annÇe, car elle est non spÇcialisÇe (le fameux cycle d'intÇgration). 
2. S'ensuit Paris-Saclay (PS), avec une premiäre annÇe dÇjÖ un peu plus centrÇe uniquement autour des mathÇmatiques et de l'informatique. 
3. Puis Paris CitÇ (PC) qui pour moi est la plus spÇcialisÇe d'entrÇe avec un accent mis sur l'informatique däs la premiäre annÇe. 

Pour rÇsumer, si tu souhaites faire de l'info avec un background scientifique gÇnÇraliste, va Ö SU. Si tu aimes les maths et que tu souhaites poursuivre en info, va Ö PS. Enfin, si tu veux toucher presque qu'Ö de l'info, va Ö PC.

Maintenant, pour rÇpondre Ö ta premiäre question, si par ""meilleur"" programme tu entends qualitÇ des cours dispensÇs, niveau gÇnÇral des Çtudiants et proximitÇ Ö la recherche et notamment Ö des laboratoires prestigieux dans le domaine de l'informatiqueˇ: je pense que SU et PS s'illustrent par rapport Ö PC. De ce cìtÇ, c'est par les spÇcialitÇs proposÇes en Masters et la proximitÇ aux laboratoires de recherche que l'on trouve SU et PS au-dessus.

Concernant la vie Çtudiante, les trois Çtablissements ont des asso internes assez actives. Paris-Saclay a beau àtre dans un campus reclus de Paris, les chantiers ont ÇnormÇment avancÇs et le campus commence enfin Ö ressembler Ö une vraie ville Çtudiante. Tu seras aussi mÇlangÇ avec des Çcoles prestigieuses comme CentraleSupelec et l'ENS Paris-Saclay (j'y ai màme eu quelques cours dans cette derniäre, c'est marrant d'àtre mÇlangÇ avec des normaliens). 

D'ailleurs áa permet de rebondir sur la question du logement : Ö PS il y a une chiÇe de rÇsidences Çtudiantes qui viennent d'àtre construites, si tu t'y prends suffisamment Ö l'avance, tu n'auras selon moi aucun probläme pour trouver, ce sera màme potentiellement plus simple qu'Ö Paris. Pour ce qui est de SU et PC, je ne sais pas trop mais j'imagine qu'il y a des associations qui pourront t'aider Ö ce sujet.

Je n'ai couvert que les universitÇs car c'est lÖ d'oó je viens, mais concernant l'UTT, j'ai pu croiser quelques personnes qui sont sorties de lÖ-bas et je n'en ai entendu que du bien. Apräs, en Çtant allÇ vite fait sur leur site, je vois que l'offre de formation en informatique a l'air quand màme träs centrÇ autour des SI. Je n'ai, Ö ma connaissance, pas vu autant de spÇcialitÇs qu'Ö SU ou PS.

Pour revenir Ö la licence informatique, je ne peux que te conseiller de t'intÇresser aux spÇcialitÇs"

If it went wrong either I didn?t travel in, drove a bit further to avoid the problem or waited it out in London.

No social life in the evenings of the day of travel but could go to art exhibitions in London (an advantage of hot desking, no one knows where you are).

Minimising cost I tried varying the pattern to buy a weekly season ticket and bunching the days together (Wed, Thur, Mon, Tues) but that was a bit disruptive.

Found staying overnight more knackering (even compared to getting home at 10pm on a bad day and having to get up at 5:30 the next day).

237,"Solo cinema trips are really nice - alone time, distracting if you need it and you don?t miss having anyone else there to keep you company. There?s loads of good stuff on at the moment, depending on your taste I suppose. Saw the Holdovers a couple of weeks back if you want something decent, feel good without being cheesy."
238,"I've worked briefly as a tour guide (on a bike) and one comment from one of my client (a lady from Montana) stuck with me : she was very upset that there were so many cars and so many people. And I did not know what to answer, because this is a 12M city, visited by millions each years, what did she expect ?

I bit my tongue but wanted to tell her that she had better visit New York or San Francisco before crossing oceans, just to make sure she actually likes cities. Because I'm pretty sure lots of people who don't like Paris just don't like big cities. And that's perfectly fine, it's just lame to discover that after you landed."
239,"T'a parti boire des verres avec les gens, combien de fois? Faire des amis en tant qu'adulte n'est pas particuliärement difficile, quel que soit le village, c'est juste qu'il faut sortir, faire des choses, rencontrer des gens. Surtout des gens qui ne sont pas enfermÇs dans leur routine et leur vie quotidienne. J'ai utilisÇ le site [meetic.com](http://meetic.com) (pas un site de rencontre) et je me rendais Ö des rÇunions d'Çchange linguistique tous les vendredis. En plus de rencontrer des gens intÇressants du monde entier, il y avait un groupe de base qui Çtait toujours prÇsent. Nous nous rÇunissions dans un cafÇ, puis nous allions dans un club ou un pub, ou nous pique-niquions sur le quai du canal Saint-Martin. C'Çtait gÇnial.

246,"Well, that's not really what it shows - it shows in an incredibly arbitrary way that it's more expensive to live in London.  Their figures of 'London' and 'rest of the country' don't take account that one person can live in a room of a shared house in central london with their partner quite happily on a *real* minimum wage while another might be struggling on ú60k living in Aberdeen as a single parent to 4 kids."

The only 2 caveats I would say in your situation are 1) you have to see if you're ok with the new level of degraded public services (nhs, transport, etc) 2) your partner would need to evaluate if starting a business or taking on a job in her domain is reasonable and satisfying for her standards with the country going into a recession"

So maybe try a month or so of doing all the boring stuff you know you're supposed to...like winding down slowly in the evenings, cutting screen time, getting a walk after work, not eating too late etc etc and see if that helps?"

To this day I don't know what he was looking for. Another agent came because it took a while and I was very stressed not knowing what i had done wrong. It lasted nearly 20 min they checked every item not saying a word to me. I boycotted the place for 6 months after that not willing to go through it again. It was so random.

You can also check :  
Glazart - This one is a hit or miss. I always had good time there, but some people hate this place. Its more on the underground side of the scene. Usually techno. You should go to their after on sunday morning.  
T7 - Beautiful club with a beautiful view of Paris, with a super good soundsystem and, almost, always good lineups. But I hate this club because of the people who are going to this place.  It's also very expensive (even for Paris standard).  
Nexus - Not quite in Paris, but very close (in the city of Pantin). It's mainly hard techno. The soundsystem is great (but very loud !) and the public can be a bit annoying.  
Fvtvr - I have not been there since the reopening so can't say anything about the sound, the vibe and the club. But if you want some good Detroit Techno, this is a good place.

Honestly, don't go clubing tonight, drink some beers, wander around the city at night. But save yourself for tomorrow ! If you are down for some adventure, you should go to GrÅv.

293,"Dear Melbourne, 

Less than 100 years ago, your favourite European cities,  that you have bookmarked on Instagram: Amsterdam, Vienna, Budapest have easily capitulated to anti-semitic sentiments that resulted to millions of Jews being sent to the horrors of Dachau and Auschwitz. These people were as middle class as many of you, and someone like Einstein could easily have been one of them. Europeans not even a hundred years ago had no qualms about what happened to every jew, from the Rhine river to the sea. Whenever you book your highly inflated airbnb, think about how easily it was stolen from a family by legitimate governments because they were Jewish.

Yet you privileged white kids perpetuate this misinformed ignorance that date back to the nazis, when you don't have to live under rocket barrages everyday in a country as small as Manawatu, the sixth biggest region in NZ. Yes, 6th. That this tiny sliver of land, squished in the middle of a region twice the size of Australia, who dispossessed millions of indigenous Jews... their possessions and ancestral homeland for millenia taken from them. Look into the mirror, and acknowledge your same complicity and hate those in Vienna, Budapest, and oh those many cultured European cities on your travel list have shown during ww2.

Oh this war didn't start on October 7th? Yea sure as hell it didn't.

The Arab-Israeli wars, particularly the war immediately following Israel's declaration of independence in 1948, underscore the existential threats Israel has faced from its inception. During these conflicts, the main issues were not about territories like the West Bank and Gaza or policies such as blockades or settlements, which became prominent in later years. Instead, the core issue was the refusal by many neighboring countries and non-state actors to recognize Israel's right to exist as a sovereign nation.

This refusal manifested in multiple military attempts to undermine or destroy the Jewish state, challenging its sovereignty and the safety of its citizens. The initial conflict and subsequent wars (such as those in 1956, 1967, and 1973) were fundamentally about the existence of Israel and its recognition in the Middle East.

I would only add that if you use a sperm donor, it?s important to maintain a connection with them for your child?s sake. A child doesn?t need a traditional family to grow up secure and happy, but generally they do need a connection to both of their biological parents.

309,"Safe lately. they just detained cargo ship with 54 cars, task force is set now, it will go down. people are fed up with insurance cost going up because of this. gazette published it at $100/year extra premiums collectively for the payments to the ones whose car were stolen. politicized by opposition now and getting under check. another thing statistically i wanna mention is that montreal does not have car theft issues as bad as toronto or ontario, its just the port is popular to ship to africa/eu, so cars stolen from all over canada are shipped from here and hence gets the news bad rap. the MAIN thing to ask yourself is does your US Insurance cover the stolen theft of car out of country or in Canada? then you won't have to worry, just lotta inconvenience though. but its not as big of a problem in montreal as i said earlier. The FIRST thing you should do is call your insurance customer service, I'd do that!"

312,"speak to your GP and get a referral for a specialist. If you have just had a c section they will want to wait for you to heal before doing any surgery. if you think you can live with the gallstones, I would avoid surgery and at most I would recommend getting the stones blasted. 

I had a bad case (over 10 large ones and tiny ones lining the entire organ).  I needed to wait two months for surgery and my surgeon agreed it was urgent. in the interim i went on a ?plain food diet? aka FODMAP. it sucked but i had less attacks. my gallbladder fused to my other organs (this is extreme), so recovery from removal was long and painful. i?ve had major surgery before that and even I struggled with the pain. I was a young and an unusual case, with my gallbladder very close to bursting. having my gallbladder removed has totally changed how I can eat, and what foods I can tolerate. it is different for everyone, but we all experience new limitations on diet. You will experience digestive issues afterwards - your liver will either not pump enough bile into your stomach or too much, because the gallbladder is not there anymore to help control the levels."
313,"OP, this restaurant is just fabulous, and service is almost perfect. We had meals there a few months ago. It was a Christmas gift from our daughter.

In option, we also ordered wines and alcohol as digestives, with coffees ??...

So, we gave about 10% more for tipping the personnel whose service was almost perfect...

It's just a way to express more how we have appreciated the service so much. Even if service is included, I always tend to think it's the subsistence minimum due for the work done, and if the work done is kinda remarkable, I add a tip to show my own satisfaction.

PS: the prices are also exceptional and pretty high. So don't be confused if you didn't give more for an additional tip... there was no faux pas."

Then we wonder why crime is getting worse, when the cops don't even try and prison is a revolving door. Look, I'm not a believer in excessive incarceration or punishment, especially for minor crimes. But fucking up someone's life arguably worse than murder should NOT be taken this lightly. There are crimes with no victims that get worse penalties than this."
315,"Sorry but this article is kind of shit and should give better advice. In the case of the creepy landlord lecturing tenants. Record them. Change locks with a different bolt but keep original. If they try to s21 challenge it providing the recording. In court as needed, this will make it very difficult to argue the s21 was done for legitimate reasons.

321,"Yea as some have stated the central line is struggling so everything?s going out, but generally speaking the reason you?re seeing more is because the generation of writers that were hitting trains years ago are in their 40-60s now, they mostly do legal walls now with the odd illegal tag here and there but a lot of those train writers would get jail time it caught doing another train panel as they have so many previous cases. The pieces you?re seeing now on trains are being done by the newer generation of writers who are 14-30 who have graduated from street tagging to trains. It?s actually kinda mad considering it?s way harder to paint graffiti now vs the 90s and early 2000s (another reason u hardly see train graffiti nowadays) but writers are innovative they always find a way"
322,"If you're serious about this, do a points test online to see if you qualify for a Permanent Residency visa (you probably do). 

Now decide if you're going to handle the visa application process yourself, or have a company like WorkingIN do it for you. I had WorkingIN do mine, not cheap, but it got done.

The whole process will cost you thousands of pounds, and it's absolutely worth it.

In terms of areas of Australia, really depends what you want, if you want a city life, country life, by the beach etc. Look up how much rent costs in the areas you're considering. Consider also that renting a place in the big cities these days is hard, it's not just cost, but availability. It's probably easier to move somewhere that isn't a big city."
323,"Mid-february, a woman, obviously on crack or something, begged for a dollar.  She was smiling and dancing as she did so. I felt bad and cornered so I pulled a dollar out.  As I placed it in her hand, I noticed her jacked unzipper, her shirt unbuttoned and her nipple jiggling in the freezing air.  

I did not want to embarass her so I just said, ""its really cold outside, you should find a place to warm up.""  I just hope she didn't get frost bite in such a highly sensitive spot.

Same for Ile des Soeurs, it realy filled up. 

Griffintown really wasn't well though out though, its all shiny new condos and zero services. I used to park there when I studied at ETS, you had to walk 20 minutes to downtown before you saw a restorant or a store. I hope it gets better for them, It felt like a promoter cashgrab more than a town."

Maybe the most importantly, I gave my parents a chance to explore the world in their 60s, as they worked hard throughout their lives and limited themselves everywhere to support me and my sis.  


One is not financial: I don't want to work for someone anymore, as you exchange your time for money by working on someone's dreams or ideas, not yours. It becomes clear when you getting paid more, sometimes it makes me miserable. So, I've started to develop myself and my mindset to get out of the corporate bullshit somehow. I work on Canary Wharf sometimes and see how fucked and brainwashed some people are by the end of the day, especially in bars/pubs around, when they spend fortunes on booze to suppress this misery."

343,"as a couple of people have said - you stop checking if your account has enough money for basic stuff.

No need to to buy the cheapest stuff at the supermarket, and no need to wonder if you've got the cash to buy it. 

I'm a stereotypical tight northerner so I still seek value for money, but not having to think about not having money is a massive brain energy saver. It definitely improves your quality of life. 

I do still take the bus (cheaper) when the train is faster (expensive) I even walk some places because that's cheaper than the bus. I still fly RyanAir/locost airlines, but i go on 6 or 7 breaks a year."

It seems like a chicken and egg problem. It's easier to find someone if you're already dating. Personally, I just give up completely. I see an attractive woman, I smile, she bites her lip and looks away. Got 2 matches on Tinder but in Mexico. One of them actually doesn't have kids! Other one beautiful but stopped replying after I told her I wasn't in Mexico but can be on a flight. I'm guessing I came across as too needy. I give up on dating apps. I give up on the job market.

Only way is to contact Council with separate complaints. Email Hobsons Bay (don't snap send solve) and advise of any unregistered/mismatched plates. Another for home run business. And lastly if you have anyone parked across your driveway call up to report."

One took me straight into a side room whilst the other must have dealt with him. So they must keep a pretty close eye on the monitor.

372,"If you're going to use a dating App, you have to commit to it. Build your profile, be honest, make an effort with your pics. Be on there for several months. Be picky. If you're 40+, you'll want to get off Tinder, or any site that relies on making snap decisions on a photo.

Outside the dating Apps, you can still make the most of being online by combining an online presence with what you like to do offline. For instance, I go to the cinema a lot and recently joined a WhatsApp cinema group. Its not a dating App, but if somebody likes your messages, you could well end up going to the cinema with them if they are in the same boat as you. Same as following a sports team, or a genre of music. There's always ways to connect that doesn't involve going on a blind date with a mate's workmate, or going up to somebody in a pub and saying you like their shoes.

Another thing you can do is learn something new (and stick to it). A lot of people learn a second language for this very reason. if you dont get lucky in dating, you'll still learn a new language. Drawing is another popular class for meeting new people. etc etc"

Le phÇnomäne du chauffeur dÇsignÇ est pratiquement disparu de nos jours, Ö la place on entend les chauffeurs dire ""je vais prendre un dernier verre et attendre une heure"". Peut-àtre qu'il faudrait ramener le chauffeur dÇsignÇ Ö la mode.

Comme les gens sont habituÇs Ö 0,08, il risque de remplir les tribunaux avec une tonne de gens qui ont passÇs les derniäres 30 annÇes Ö conduite prudemment Ö 0,08 et Ö les transformer en criminels.

**Il y a pas de juste mesure**

Comme j'ai dit: Ö 0,05 t'es correct et ils te laisse partir, Ö 0,06 t'es assis sur le siäge arriäre d'une voiture de police et tu te ramasse Ö payer un avocat $15,000 pour essayer d'Çviter une dossier criminel...

0,05 ou moins t'es correct.

Plus que 0,05 la police remorque ton char pour 24 heures

Plus que 0,08, la police t'arràte et remorque ton char et tu a une accusation criminelle.

404,"Melbourne is seriously behind in city planning and infrastructure on the global stage. 

We laughed at the posts about Americans asking where everyone parked at the MCG, but Melbourne is seriously not much better. The infrastructure that allows the stadiums to be largely car free  is only possible due to PT infrastructure from over 100 years ago. Look at the parking around any suburban shopping centre. We are much more American than we are European, and it's time we stopped pretending we are European just because we have trams and cafes. 

If you've ever driven or walked under the Montague Street interchange you will know how absolutely car obsessed and pedestrian  unfriendly much of Melbourne is and how far we are to ever freeing ourselves from car dependency. 

Labor keeps getting voted in because they care a little bit more about PT compared to the Libs, but we somehow have ended up with 2 more freeway projects with minimal media complaints. Yet a storm was raised by every single media outlet when the SRL was announced, for months on end. Not like NEL and WGT costs in excess of 36 billion dollars now, which is more than the first leg of SRL. 

We still haven't heard of any tram line extensions, no City loop reconfiguration nor Metro tunnel 2 or trains to Doncaster, Chadstone, Rowville or Clyde discussed at all. Not even a simple timetable update to provide increased frequency off peak and weekends on all lines. 

We haven't even begun to address suburban sprawl and Euclidean zoning which is literally the entire reason traffic is so bad in the first place.

When we got the proofs they had photoshopped grass instead of the bark chips, apart from one photo (so incompetent as well as dishonest). I told the RE agent to undo the photoshopping. He grumbled but did as I asked.

It raises a few points.

* If the pictures have been photoshopped the owner has approved them
* It sets up the expectation that the RE are lying (and if they are lying about the grass, what else are they lying about).
* Do they really expect people not to notice that the grass isn't there in reality?
*  If people are only coming to see the house because it has grass they are going to be upset. Everyone else doesn't care - so why do it?"
409,"First of all, undergraduate students are sometimes admitted to the CitÇ Internationale Universitaire (linked on another comment) depending on availability, so he should absolutely apply and see. It's a wonderful environment, in a convenient location and is generally affordable.

There's quite a few reputable rental agencies specializing in catering to foreign students/incoming expats, through which you can reserve before arrival. They are more expensive than the market average, some might charge high one-time reservation fees but I think they make sense for an exchange student. Finding a place in Paris otherwise is a painstaking process to say the least. That being said, if your budget can reach around 800 ? / month and above up to 1000 ?, it should be quite straightforward to book a place from the agencies below. Expect between 350-900 one-time reservation fees. You might be asked a deposit of one to two month's rent. If you're targeting a rent around 650 to 800 per month, it might be a bit more tricky/a longer search/higher number of flatmates. Here's the agencies that I know and came across on my own search (apart from Paris Attitude that's already mentioned):

[https://colivys.com/](https://colivys.com/) -- seems very well rated but they charge quite high one-time reservation fees (I ran into something like 700 ?ˇand noped out).

[https://www.livecolonies.com/en](https://www.livecolonies.com/en) -- another flatsharing company. reservation fees are not as high but locals would consider the rents they are asking to be outrageous. 

[https://www.paris-hospitality.com/](https://www.paris-hospitality.com/) -- they have many studios and rent to exchange students/foreigners often. again rents much higher than the market rates but if you can afford it it shouldn't be a problem. apparently they also started a dorm-like project: [https://www.thesocialhub.co/](https://www.thesocialhub.co/) (very expensive and seemingly upscale)

[https://openhousecoliving.com/en/](https://openhousecoliving.com/en/) -- another very well rated flat/house-share company.

[https://www.morningcroissant.fr/](https://www.morningcroissant.fr/) -- again seems legit but very high reservation fee (I found 800-900 ?).

[https://www.lodgis.com/en/](https://www.lodgis.com/en/) -- they do a lot of short-term rentals to foreigners (not to mean you can't rent for many months). one downside is their listings are not eligible for rent aid (foreign students can get a little bit of monthly rent aid from the French government. For me it's around 130 ?/month. there was talk of a change of law on that so I'm not sure if exchange students can still get it). Another downside is, well, it's expensive. 

[https://www.studapart.com/en](https://www.studapart.com/en) -- a variety of options, from family stays to dorms."

438,"A lot of well-meaning advice but not sure how many people giving the advice have actually trained in martial arts or had a physical confrontation in London.

The ugly truth is that martial arts are unlikely to help you fight and beat a potential attacker, unless you're just as as big and strong as the average man.

The benefit martial arts might give you is dealing with high pressured situations but that is it.

My recommendations would be

1. get good at running
2. lift weights
3. get a personal attack alarm and keep it attached to your keys
4. God forbid you're in a situation where a man actually has gotten in your face or grabbed you, poke his eyes out and show no mercy. Get your fingers deep in the eye hole and then leg it.
5. I'm sorry you were followed, I would advise getting into a coffee shop next time and just seeking safety for a bit and maybe get the help of a passerby OR get on the phone and these guys usually back off.
6. If you do martial arts, do BJJ and go often.
7. If I'm walking home late at night (yes I'm a man) or in the dark, I'll periodically check my shoulder and make sure no one is following me. If someone is walking towards me I'll turn around and look once they pass me to make sure they haven't turned around to follow me - this actually happened once in a dark alleyway.

I've lived in london all my life and I realise you really do need to keep your eyes open and head on a swivel unfortunately. That alone has gotten me out of a few potential horrible situations"

440,"I think the staff were wrong about the wheelchair spaces. There are at least two on every boat but they are normally at the back, by the toilets (glamorous). Not all staff are properly trained in all boat layouts so they probably just put you somewhere to keep you out of the way...

I use the Thames clipper from time to time as a power wheelchair user and it's very dependent on the tide as to how easy it is to get on and off. Only once have I actually been unable to get off the boat and that was at Canary Wharf when the water was so choppy the ramp was actually not touching the boat half the time so I just noped out. 

Given there is no possible way to control the tidal system entirely, I do think they've done a pretty good job of providing accessibility on board the boats. But definitely room for improvement in terms of the actual facilities on board."
441,"I did the atelier de sevres for two years, great preparatory school, I don?t think they offer scholarships anymore and the prices has gone up quite a bit. 

Honestly Art school are difficult to join in Paris, few places for a lot of demands. The public school are great and with a big reputation. But I wasn?t fond of the people, it is quite a competitive environment, you don?t make real friends, so I went in a Beau art in a smaller City. And now, I dropped out this year to work in the agricultural fiel and work on my art project by myself (mural paintings/tattoo/illustration) and I am doing ok.

Anyway, i am just not made for school. I would still recommend my preparatory class, there is a lot of different nationalities, Colombian, American, Chinese, Japanese ? if you can keep up with the amount of work and pressure, you will enjoy your time there. I don?t know much about the private school except the Gobelin who?s one of the best animation/graphisme school worldwide, they just don?t take student without a strong technique. And it is pretty much the same for the two public school I have in mind, 

Beau Art, this one is more diverse and will form you into contemporary art, so no need for a great technique if you have good Æˇconceptual  thinkingˇØ if you understand, student do a lot of performances, some paint but on an other level, it touch pretty much everything, it helps you form into an artist. You could do video, photo, metal sculpture, ceramics etc ? it helps you build your project. But will hardly form you on the technic, you will have to either have a strong base or explore by yourself or with the person at the different shops of the school. 

And Les arts deco, it is pretty much the same but with more attention on the technical aspects, if you are more interested in graphism, design, illustration, I think also animation but more experimental compared to the Gobelin. A lot of famous comics authors did this school, you will have a lot of open door at the end and during your time there. 

Both schools are multicultural witch is nice, but also quite hard to enroll. My preparatory class had the best success 6 years ago for the three I talk about, I don?t know, how it is now. Direction has changed witch could be better for the mental health of the students compared to when I was in. But I know it was picked up by people we weren?t so fond of, a group that already owned other art schools that had a the reputation of being paid to win but for nothing, I think the teacher are still the same though.

You will need to be independent, have a strong cultural knowledge, be curious, quite sociable. The down, except for the Gobelin where you need to work with other students and learn to work in team, is a competitive field, you need shoulders. But it prepares you quite well for after, it makes you crafty, able to pick up quickly on a lot of different things.

445,"Having lived always in inner city, this has been my market during all my time in Melbourne. I can't compare Vic Market with other suburban markets  but here's my thoughts:
1. One of the best ways to understand a city is to visit its markets. Vic Market represents a lot of things Melbourne. The few remaining old sections, sheds, people from different parts of the world, food and produce from various parts of Victoria and elsewhere in the world.
2. It's a great place for the social aspect, specially on weekends. Grabbing your favorite brunch from the deli section ( or the Donut, food trucks). The deli / dairy hall section is my particularly favorite. Over the years I have become a regular at some of the shops there. Mkt Lane coffee, MG Caifa, Ripe Cheese and the numerous deli shops whose name unfortunately i never bothered to check, just remember by the faces across the counter.
3.The Wednesday night markets in summer and winter months is always a great place to catch up with friends. 
4.Groceries, farm produce are of decent quality and you can get these at reasonable prices. Not a big shopper of meat and fish, so can't comment much about the meat hall.

At a personal level, during the covid lickdown years, Vic Market was the only place I could go to for a number of months. Those coffee, bakery and jam filled donuts have played a role in being sane through those difficult times of lockdown, useless cops roaming the city and helicopters patrolling the air. :)"

When coming from barons court I usually find they are more likely to swap the barking train to high street Kensington. If a barking train has an upminster train behind it I'll sometimes literally just wait skip the barking train. Then if I see an absolute horde waiting to get on at earls court I can tell that it was swapped.

Also why is the city service so fucking infrequent at peak times. If you go catch it not long past 7am there's a train every 2 minutes, as soon as you get near 8am they are more like every 7-10 mins. It ends up with the platform just getting packed for every train with not enough room for everyone to get on"

The beautiful thing is that you dont need to pay it off in 30 years.

489,"Paris is incredibly dense compared to outer Paris areas. Not only the population density is two to three times higher than other part of the urban area, but the amount of shops is 10 times higher than other districts. This means that people from outer Paris always go there for works, dinner, hobbies, etc. Even if 50% of them use public transportations, you will still have 50% of people from the outside of Paris who go there daily with car, plus some Parisiens who also use their car inside of Paris. This will probably change in two or three years when Grand Paris is achieved and other districts will have trains services as competitive as Parisˇ"

Secondly, don't give up on dating apps. I know it can be a grind as I have been on them myself, but your age is actually an advantage as people in that age-group generally are looking for the same thing you are.

534,"Well, the fact that the Parisian metropolitan area is much bigger and populated than even the second largest metropolitan area (Marseille), it feeds the feeling that it is the only city that?s ?worth it? in France (wrongly so and not to make any generalization) and in the worst behaviors of Parisians there is this feeling of being better than ?La province?, at least that is an aspect of me and my friends? experience, from Marseille, with going to Paris. I have an anecdote that illustrates perfectly. I was in Lyon, about to board a train and there was 2 trains departing at the same time, one to Paris, the other to Marseille. I was overhearing someone of the train station staff ask for people?s destination so that there wasn?t any confusion and error. He then asked a girl (she must have been 30) if she was going to Marseille and she answered with disgust: ?eww no, Paris?. Not all Parisians are like that (and ?Marseillais? can have the same attitude toward Paris) but that stuck with me haha.

Maybe this attitude may expend to other countries as a form of snobbery?

Another factor is that there was always a sort of rivalry between France and Great Britain (we fought a few wars), and some of it has left, in my view, traces in the French culture, as a sort of disengagement with the English culture and language, especially in older generations that just don?t want to learn or speak English. In practice it isn?t so much the case anymore, but some of it must have stuck a little bit. Sometimes non-English-natives can get a better treatment as they?re not speaking in their native language either, it can change the dynamic I think. Although that?s not a rule ??

Lastly, there can be rude people in other parts of France that can also be rude toward other French people, I won?t region-name-drop but I think most French people have had this experience ??

At least this is my analysis, what do you think, other French people?"

540,"Paris is a city at the end of the day and while the historical aesthetic and tradition of its architecture are important, it's primary purpose is to house the residential and commercial needs of the city. 

Destroying the tower just because people don't like it would be very expensive and problematic and would likely not affect the actual quality of what the city offers from a residential, commercial, and touristic perspective. 

I don't like the tower, but I also don't like the Montparnasse area. I don't think about the tower unless I see it, but honestly it has a place in my heart. It's that one ugly ass part of Paris that I don't know why they built it, but they did and I think I might be a bit sad if it was gone. 

As an aside, everyone hated the Eiffel tower when it was built so imagine if they listened to everyone and demolished it. In 100 years, Montparnasse might evoke the same romantic emotions that the Eiffel tower does today ??"

I was still happy to go out but I might be drinking orange juice or cola.

I then explored other ways to make friends through my hobbies- they are made from a varied age make-up, so phone calls, coffee catch ups on the weekends and dog walks have taken over. 

I'm finding that life and work demands are particularly challenging.

So when I finish work I just want to go home, prepare a decent meal and chill out.

556,"This is not your typical pepper spray, which is an aerosol.

This is more like spicy shaving foam.

More product ends up on your target and the coverage is 'better'."
557,"Hi ! 

I?ve passed through depression in 2019. 
I really wanted help and had no doctor. I went to a clsc after i called info-santÇ and asked what i could do and they couldn?t do anything but told me that it would be better to have a referral to meet a social worker and psychiatrist from the clsc (but they couldn?t give one as i had to ask a doctor not from the clsc for the referral). The person i spoke with from the clsc told me to simply go to a clinic sans rendez-vous and explain what i was going through and ask for a clsc referral for the psychiatrist and social worker) which i was given with a prescription for anti-depressants. 

I ended up getting a call from the CLSC and got the help needed. I had a psychiatrist help me to find the proper meds, a doctor following me monthly to see if i needed adjustments and also someone where i could speak to. It really helped me. 

I went to the clinic on Sherbrooke/Cartier and the doctor i had really helped me (they are specialized with mental health).

There's also that one Atwater exit where a group of bums decided to make their home in. They smoke, drink and party in there while the police are right outside walking around Cabot square. I guess it's weird that they don't kick them out but then again maybe they tried and just gave up."

565,I've always imagined London to be a seductive femme fatale. London lours you in with promises of making your wildest dreams come true but chews most people up like fodder and spits them back. I love London but is it worth it? I don't know. I read an article recently that mentioned you need an ú80k salary to be happy.

575,"I've lived in central London for about 5 years now and love(d) it. My husband and I used to take full advantage of it - going to tonnes of art galleries, the theatre, loads of great restaurants, parties, going clubbing or to day festivals and just walking home, etc. It's been wonderful and we were also lucky enough to rent a flat before things got really crazy on the market and then buy just as we went into covid, so a lot aligned for us. 

We have a baby now and are doing the usual 'have kids, leave London' thing, this year, partially because we want more space and partially because we just don't really take advantage of London life as much any more so the costs/benefits don't make sense the way they used to. 

I also can't say I love all of London. It's a cluster of villages, some of them are incredibly charming and others are either shit or kind of soulless. I think one mistake people make is not realizing that, and end up in a part that doesn't work for them. Of course the money thing also means many don't have too much flexibility on that front."

In response to your question, the Brits don't really have any opinion. Unless you're in a small town. Then you'll hear some very conservative comments.

581,"I find it's the same all over France. People (tourists) perceive French people as rude when infact it's the opposite - French people very much value politeness to an extreme. Walk up to someone speaking loud English whilst they're just going about their day? Yeah sure they're gonna be rude. How would you feel if someone just waltzed up to you speaking klingon?

You've just gotta be confident enough to speak your best (worst) French, always say good day thankyou please, always smile - 9 times out of 10 they'll switch to English once they see you're respectful and have made the bare minimum effort to learn some basic French.

It sounds a bit like being made to jump through a ring but I equate it to southern USA culture - ""have a nice day!"". Doesn't matter if you mean it or not, just make the small amount of effort and life will be so much easier."
582,"The market should find a balance eventually.

587,"Living in st Henri since 2021.
Pros: can walk everywhere, don't need a car (like others mentioned)
Proximity to market, gyms, cafÇs, is great. Canal is also great, no matter the season. 
Most neighbours of mine are young professionals, everyone's kind.

Cons: There has been constant construction, (water lines, infrastructure updates) which have been very irritating but at least done (for now)

Problems with garbage as well, I noticed, in the sense that some will leave out garbage days before pick up, letting squirrels and rats the time to make a mess on the sidewalk.

Overall, being In st Henri is a trade off, living close to everything but dealing with some issues (homelessness, garbage and it's smells, construction woes) that I don't mind putting up with."

592,"Quebec and Ottawa: try visiting both cities, they have their own charisma. Ottawa can be made in one day including the Parliament Tower (book in advance); as for parking, there's some around downtown. Quebec city is worth staying one night if you're driving since it's a 3-hours drive to Montreal. Both cities are walkable.

Montreal: if you're staying downtown or close to a Metro (subway) station, try using it. Parking in Montreal can be a tad tricky because of the sometimes contradictory regulations, so sometimes the best is to use underground parking (check the fees before). Downtown is also walkable.
Things to do: 
- old Montreal and the old port
- Notre-Dame Cathedral
- Mont-Royal and its belvedere
- walking from Crescent to Place des Arts
- Drive around Westmount and Outremont
- Museum of Fine Arts
- eat smoked meat and poutine
- sip a drink in a terrace
- check for any festival"

594,"TL;DR: areas and % of adults not making a real living wage (which is set to ú13.15 in London and ú12 in the rest of the country by [The Living Wage Foundation](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/)):  

Area | % making below living wage
:-: | :--
Haringey | 32.7%
Brent | 29.5%
Waltham Forest | 28.8%
Bexley | 28.5%  
Redbridge | 28.2% 
Hyndburn (Lancashire) | 26.3%
Harrow | 26.1% 
Mansfield (Nottinghamshire) | 25.3%
East Lindsey (Lincolnshire) | 25.0%
Thanet (Kent) | 24.7%  

Data covers April 2023, and [the full report](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/employee-jobs-paid-below-real-living-wage-2023) is on the Living Wage Foundation website.  

So yes, partly the London boroughs show up 'cause the living wage is set higher here, but it's bleak in a lot of places. Not sure how long we can keep calling this a cost of living crisis when 1/4 to 1/3 people making the legal minimum wage can't actually live of their salaries. It's a crisis of inequality."

596,"I have been pulled over twice in Australia. Once was in 2008 when thought I was in a 60 zone but it was a 50 zone. That was a speeding fine.

And then there was Jan 1 2024 in Wodonga, when I was pulled over ostensibly for not indicating as I exited the water tower roundabout into the main street (the police van was the vehicle behind me, and I did not indicate). No fine though, the police checked my licence, asked me why I was in town (New Year's with my mum) and that was it.

This is a complicated round-about. It has five spokes, but the first exit is via a left lane that must exit. I was not in that lane, and took the next exit. Is that then the first exit or the second exit? It is the continuation of what was I guess once the same road before there was a round about, so by the protractor I think it is 180 degrees. BUt it is only 2 out five exits. Is that less than half way? 

  
TO be fair to the police, I indicated right and was planning on taking the third exit, but I changed my mind when I remembered the fuel station down there was closed. It seems there are so many ways to get a fine on a roundabout I should count myself lucky.  


So I have a new habit. Indicate like a christmas tree if there is a police car behind."
